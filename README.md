# License-Plate-Reader
This project implements an optical character recognition (OCR) pipeline designed to extract alphanumeric text from vehicle license plates. The reader focuses on clean plate images as an initial scope, providing a foundation for future expansion into more challenging conditions such as motion blur, noise, and varying lighting environments.
